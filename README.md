# [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) scraper for Anki flashcards

First of all, a quick disclaimer: this script doesn't actually create Anki flashcards. It creates a `<language>.tsv` file which you can then import into Anki.

Basically, it takes the [list of words you've learned](https://www.duolingo.com/words) and retrieves their [definition](https://www.duolingo.com/dictionary) which it writes into a spreadsheet.

You are free to modify and share the script as you wish (see [license](https://github.com/rykerish/duolingo_scraper/blob/main/LICENSE)). However, note that if you change it, the Anki template (`Template.apkg`) will probably not be valid anymore.

## Initialising

Made using Python 3.8.5

Import `Template.apkg` into Anki to have the card template. The code will not work if you try to download media without having Anki installed.

Note that when login in to Duolingo, you should use your username (the API doesn't seem to support email login)

### On Linux / OS X

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### On Windows 10

Run `py -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt`

### On Windows < 10

Run `python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt`

## Running

Run the script and follow the instructions (I have tried to make them as clear as possible).

### On Linux / OS X

`python scrape_duo_words.py`

### On Windows 10

`py scrape_duo_words.py`

### On Windows < 10

`python3 scrape_duo_words.py`

## Importing into Anki

Open Anki, click "Import File" and choose the resulting `<language>.tsv` file. 

Set the card Type to `duolingo` (from the Template), and select your target deck; fields should be separated by Tab.

***Make sure the "Allow HTML in fields" option is checked or you won't have audio and images.***

Unless you modified the script or did not use the default fields when running the script, the field mapping should be done automatically.

Now you can just import and practice!
